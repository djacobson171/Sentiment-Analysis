# Sentiment-Analysis
This program is a sentiment analysis project that allows a user to input a news article and predicts its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using a machine learning model. The project starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and nltk. Then, it loads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and explores the data by visualizing the sentiment distribution. After that, the data is split into training and testing sets, and preprocessing steps are defined. The machine learning pipeline is defined using the CountVectorizer and MultinomialNB. The model is trained and evaluated, and the accuracy is printed. Then, GridSearchCV is used to fine-tune the model, and the best parameters and accuracy are printed. The Vader library is used to analyze the sentiment of input text, and a function is defined to predict the sentiment based on the compound score. Finally, the user is allowed to input new text data, and the program predicts its sentiment. If the prediction is incorrect, the user is asked for feedback, and the training data is updated accordingly. The user can also ask for the most informative features for the classifier and see the current accuracy of the model.
